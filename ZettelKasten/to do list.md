**You:** _"Hey! I'm really excited about my new job at Backbase. Let me tell you a bit about what we do."_

**Relative:** _"Sure, I'd love to hear about it!"_

**You:** _"So, Backbase helps banks and financial institutions improve how they interact with their customers online and through mobile apps. Think about how you use your bank’s website or app to check your balance, transfer money, or apply for a loan. Backbase provides the tools and platform that make those services smooth, user-friendly, and secure."_

**Relative:** _"Oh, that sounds interesting. How exactly do you do that?"_

**You:** _"Great question! We offer something called the Backbase Engagement Banking Platform. It’s like a comprehensive toolkit that banks use to create and manage their digital services. This platform helps banks offer a variety of services across different areas such as retail banking, business banking, and wealth management—all in one integrated system."_

**Relative:** _"Can you break that down a bit more?"_

**You:** _"Of course! For **retail banking**, we help banks provide everyday services like checking and savings accounts, loans, and credit cards in a way that's easy for customers to use online or on their phones. For **business banking**, we support services that businesses need, such as managing their accounts, handling transactions, and accessing business loans efficiently. And for **wealth management**, we enable banks to offer investment tools and financial planning services to help customers grow and manage their wealth."_

**Relative:** _"That makes sense. So, what's the main goal of Backbase?"_

**You:** _"Our main mission is to enhance the customer experience. By using our platform, banks can offer personalized and seamless services, making banking more convenient and enjoyable for their customers. This not only helps banks attract and keep customers but also allows them to stay competitive in today's digital world."_

**Relative:** _"It sounds like you're helping banks keep up with technology and make things easier for everyone."_

**You:** _"Exactly! We make it easier for banks to modernize their services without having to build everything from scratch. This way, they can focus on what they do best—serving their customers—while we handle the technology side to ensure everything runs smoothly and efficiently."_

**Relative:** _"That's really cool. It's great to see how technology can improve everyday services like banking."_

**You:** _"Absolutely! And it's exciting to be part of a team that's making a real difference in how people manage their finances and interact with their banks."_
